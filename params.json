  "body": "# CatalyXtraction\r\n### Idea\r\n* I wanted a way to extract the workouts from a workout routine on Catalyst Weightlifting website\r\n* I wanted to take these workouts and be able to view only a particular day's workout without having to scroll\r\n\r\n### Steps To Use\r\n* Download the HTML doc for almost any workout routing from [Catalyst](https://www.catalystathletics.com/olympic-weightlifting-workouts/training-programs/) to a location you'll remember\r\n* Place the path to your HTML doc in the python [script](https://github.com/rhudgeons/BeautifulSoup/blob/master/Catalyst/oly_program.py) like below:\r\n```ruby\r\ndocument = BeautifulSoup(open('path/to/your/workout/html'))\r\n```\r\n* Run: ```python oly_program.py``` \r\n\r\n* Open ```extracted_workouts.html``` in Chrome\r\n\r\n### To Dos\r\n* I will be adding styling to this so it's easier to look at\r\n* Maybe write info to a csv file to view in Microsoft Excel too\r\n* Use a GUI so you do not have to 1) use the command line to use and 2) enter the path to the downloaded HTML file on a prompt\r\n* Give it the URL instead of having to download the HTML file\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis was a very minimalist project, so don't critique too much. I was just thinking of ways to use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) while learning a little python syntax. I use it myself and find it easier to use rather than scrolling through an entire workout routine.\r\n",
